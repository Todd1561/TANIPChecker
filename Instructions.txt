This program is used to alert you via email that your public IP address has changed.  This can be useful in residential or commercial situations with internet connections that have dynamically assigned IP addresses, allowing you to be notified of your new IP address remotely.  Run tanipchecker /help for a list of command line arguments.  You'll generally want to run this program on a scheduled task to actively monitor your IP address.
